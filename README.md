go-collins is a client library for [Collins](http://tumblr.github.io/collins/)
(our inventory management database) written in Go. It covers the full API and
allows you to manage your assets and their data from Go applications. It is
very much influenced by the beautiful [go-github
project](https://github.com/google/go-github).

## Usage

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) to indicate what the scope of
changes between versions are. Each version is tagged as a release on github, so
you can use go mod to ensure you are getting the version you expect, and upgrade
between versions in a safe manner.

If you are not using go modules you can make sure you're using the expected
major version by using the `gopkg.in` import path:

```
import "gopkg.in/tumblr/go-collins.v1/collins"
```

To start querying collins, import go-collins and set up a new `Client`
by using `NewClient()` or `NewClientFromYaml()`. The second function will look
for a `collins.yml` file and use credentials from it, while `NewClient()` takes
credentials as parameters.

```
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/tumblr/go-collins/collins"
)

func main() {
	client, err := collins.NewClient("username", "password", "https://collins.example.com")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Could not set up collins client: %s", err)
	}
	// Use client to interact with collins
}
```

In the client struct, there are pointers to services that can be used to talk
to specific parts of the API. The most common use (at least at Tumblr) is
talking to the asset API for things like getting the number of physical CPUs in
an asset:

```
asset, _, err := client.Assets.Get("assettag1")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Errorf("Assets.Get returned error: %s", err)
}
fmt.Printf("CPUs: %d\n", len(asset.Hardware.CPUs))
```

Or finding assets that match certain criteria:

```
opts := collins.AssetFindOpts{
	Status: "Unallocated",
}

assets, _, err := client.Assets.Find(&opts)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Errorf("Assets.Find returned error: %s", err)
}

fmt.Printf("First unallocated tag: %s\n", assets[0].Metadata.Tag)
```

### Pagination

Some routes in the API (finding assets and fetching logs) are paginated. To
support pagination we include pagination information in the Request struct
returned by the functions. The members are `PreviousPage`, `CurrentPage`,
`NextPage` and `TotalResults`. These together with the `PageOpts` struct can be
used to navigate through the pages.

```
opts := collins.AssetFindOpts{
	Status: "Unallocated",
	PageOpts: collins.PageOpts{Page: 0}
}

for {
	assets, resp, err := client.Assets.Find(&opts)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Assets.Find returned error: %s", err)
	}

	for _, asset := range assets {
		fmt.Printf("Tag: %s\n", asset.Tag)
	}

	if resp.NextPage == resp.CurrentPage { // No more pages
		break
	} else { // Fetch next page
		opts.PageOpts.Page++
	}
}
```
